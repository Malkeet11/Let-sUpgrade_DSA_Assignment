**Introduction- Data Structure and Algorithms :**
There are several basic and advanced structure types and data structures are designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.

The data structures are used to do operations on data using different algorithms.

Algorithms are a set of finite steps to do any particular task.

**Time Complexity and Space Complexity**
Best algorithms are selected on the basis of time and space complexities.
The program having less time complexity and less space complexity is an efficient program.

**Input and Output in Python**
We donâ€™t need to declare a variable with its data type; in python, we can declare it by only writing the variable name and assigning the values directly.
The built-in function input()  can be used to take input directly.
To print any message, we just need to put the message in double quotes or single quotes inside the input() function.
Example: 

x = input('enter a val:'); 
y = input('enter another val: ');
Plus Operator:- 

print( x + y) [+ plus operators concatenates the strings]
