# Data Structures and Algorithm Essentials FEB 2021 Batch 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Day 1 : 
Data Structure and why it is needed?

Career Opportunities/packages with this skill

Algorithm and Selecting the best Algorithm

Python Basics

Inputs and Outputs in Python


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introduction- Data Structure and Algorithms :**
There are several basic and advanced structure types and data structures are designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.

The data structures are used to do operations on data using different algorithms.

Algorithms are a set of finite steps to do any particular task.

**Time Complexity and Space Complexity**
Best algorithms are selected on the basis of time and space complexities.
The program having less time complexity and less space complexity is an efficient program.

**Input and Output in Python**
We donâ€™t need to declare a variable with its data type; in python, we can declare it by only writing the variable name and assigning the values directly.
The built-in function input()  can be used to take input directly.
To print any message, we just need to put the message in double quotes or single quotes inside the input() function.
Example: 

x = input('enter a val:'); 
y = input('enter another val: ');
Plus Operator:- 

print( x + y) [+ plus operators concatenates the strings]

## DAY 2 :
Lists and its operations in Python

Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Behaviour of Algorithms with graph

Asymptotic Rotation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List
Collection of same or different Datatypes enclosed within [ ]
List is Mutable
Slicing

Taking out a part of the list is called Slicing.
If the index entered is n then the slicing will take place till n-1
Inclusive of starting index but not of ending index
There are three things in Slicing- Start index, end index, step value
Operations on List

Insertion- To add any element to the list.
Ex- l.insert(3, 12)- Adding element 12 at index 3.

Deletion- To delete an element from the list
Ex- l.pop(3)- Deleting element from index 3.

 l.remove(30)- Deleting element 30

Time Complexity
It quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Space Complexity
It quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Asymptotic Notation
Big O- For the worst scenario
Big Omega- For the best scenario
Theta_ For average scenario
Examples of Time Complexity

Constant
Linear
Logarithmic
Exponential
